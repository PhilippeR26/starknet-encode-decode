## Presentation :
Serialize data to send to Starknet network (ex 100_u256 -> 100,0)  
Deserialize a Starknet response (ex 100,0 -> 100_u256)

This DAPP provides the corresponding [Starknet.js](https://www.starknetjs.com/) code to perform each operation. So it has also a pedagogical purpose.

> **Stars are highly appreciated! Thanks in advance.**

## Getting Started ðŸš€ :
You can directly access to the deployed DAPP [here](https://starknet-encode-decode-philipper26.vercel.app/).

You can also test it locally :
First, run the development server:
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel ðŸŽŠ :
The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Participating :
This little project is a free time project. So, I don't affect a lot of time on it. If you want to participate to improve it, please open first an issue. Any PR proposed without preliminary discussion in an issue will be immediately scrapped.
